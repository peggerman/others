                Hey, I'm Lil Magnitoe! I'm a 13-year-old rapper from South Florida, currently living in the DMV area. I'm still pretty new to the game, but I'm working hard to make a name for myself. Check out my music and let me know what you think!<br><br>

                I've been making music since I was 10 years old, and I've been fortunate enough to have been able to perform at some pretty great venues. I've been lucky enough to open for some big names, like Tee Grizzley and J.I.D. I've also been able to do some touring with my good friends, the Yung Bae Boys.

                I'm really passionate about my music and I love being able to connect with my fans. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my music and my live shows. I'm also really excited about the future of music and I'm always on the lookout for new artists and new sounds.

                I'm just a kid from the DMV, doing my thing and trying to make a name for myself. I'm grateful for all the support I've received from my fans and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next.<br><br>

                So, that's a little bit about me. If you have any questions or just want to talk music, feel free to reach out to me on social media or email. Thanks for listening!<br><br>
